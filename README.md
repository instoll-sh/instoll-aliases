# 🔗 instoll-aliases

Welcome to the `instoll-aliases` repository! This repository contains aliases for packages used with the [**instoll**](https://github.com/instoll-sh/instoll) tool. 

## 📋 Aliases in This Repository

This repository provides a curated list of aliases for **good** packages. Aliases make it easier to install packages by using short, memorable names instead of full package identifiers.

For example, instead of `instoll hikariatama/Hikka`, you can simply write `instoll hikka`
